# Materials & Methods {#sec-methodology-materials}

This chapter provides a description of the data sources in @sec-data-description , followed by the description of methodological approach used to answer the research questions in @sec-methodology.

## Data sources {#sec-data-description}

The finel dataset that we use for modelling is the result of merging information from various sources. In comparison to the current approach, we include information from further data sources (see @sec-data-prep). The following @tbl-data-sources provides a overview of the data sources used for the project.

: Overview of data sources {#tbl-data-sources}

[^03-methodology-1]: The building floor plan servers as basis to calculate the distance to the next building and therby extract the information if a building is stand-alone or directly connected to another buidling.

The building information data from the RBD and energy consumption was directly extracted from the database of the cantonal energy statistics to ensure the same data basis as the current approach. Thus, these two datasets were already joined and cleaned during the process of the energy statistics and enhanced with infromation from further sources (e.g. information from the database of the cantonal inspection of combustion systems).[^03-methodology-2]

[^03-methodology-2]: For further information, see @statistischesamtdeskantonsbasel-stadt2017. The report provides a detailed description of the data sources that are joined with the data from the RBD in the cantonal energy statistics.

The data on inhabitants, the retrofit information as well as the building floor plan contained the Swiss Building Identification Number (EGID) that serves as unique identifier to match the information with the RBD data.

In the case of the elevation information and demographic characteristics, the data was added by spatial joins. The elevation information was retrieved from the digital elevation model provided by swisstopo via Application Programming Interface (API). By using the building coordinates, the elevation (meters above sealevel) of each building was retrieved from the API[^03-methodology-3]. The demographic characteristics from STATPOP were only available at an aggregated level of a hectare grid. In order to match the information to the RBD data, the two datasets were spatially joined and all buildings within a hectare grid cell were assigned the corresponding attributes from STATPOP[^03-methodology-4].

[^03-methodology-3]: See the [code on Github](https://github.com/lucahuesler/masterthesis_energy/blob/322bcd41c13024d0d5b23a189ad75e3ecdfc4d26/helpers/helper_functions.R#L5 "Github") for details.

[^03-methodology-4]: For the spatial join between RBD and STATPOP data, the open-source geographic information system software [Quantum GIS (QGIS)](https://www.qgis.org/de/site/ "Quantum GIS (QGIS)") was used.

Finally, the building floor plan was again matched by the EGID and then used to calculate the distance to the next building and thereby to determine if a building is directly connected to another building or stand alone (see @sec-data-prep for details).

## Methodology {#sec-methodology}

In order to address the research questions defined in @sec-research-questions, a suitable methodology is required. The Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM, see @fig-crisp-dm) offers conceptual framework that was originally designed for the field of data mining by @wirth2000, but also serves as a guideline for many data science projects [@hotz2022].

![CRISP-DM Diagram [@hotz2022]](figures/03-CRISP-DM.png){#fig-crisp-dm fig-align="center" width="60%"}

Inspired by the CRISP-DM process model, we define the following methodological steps for our use case:

1.  Problem understanding and definition
2.  Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3.  Data preparation and cleaning
4.  Modelling
5.  Model evaluation
6.  Model selection and deployment

It is important to note however that we did not follow the above steps in a linear manner. Usually, after creating a first set of models, the evaluation leads to new insights that result in additional feature engineering steps or even a reframing of the initial problem understanding. Accordingly, as shown in @fig-modelling-process, numerous models were developed and evaluated throughout the modelling process.

![A schematic for the typical modeling process [@silge2023a].](figures/03-fig-modelling-process.png){#fig-modelling-process width="80%"}

In the following subsections, we will discuss the steps listed above in the context of the present study.

### Problem understanding and definition {#sec-data-unterstanding-and-exploration}

This first step of the process corresponds mainly to the @sec-introduction and @sec-theoretical-background of this study. This phase involved the exchange with experts and the study of relevant literature on the topic. @sec-problem-definition and @sec-research-questions are the results of this step. As discussed above, the problem definition has constantly been refined throughout the following steps. The integration of the retrofit information for example was not explicitly part of the initial outline, but came up during the later stages of data exploration and preparation.

### Data understanding and exploration {#sec-data-understanding-and-exploration}

This step involves the collection of the data, assessing its quality and also identify possible limitations. We explored the structure and content of each dataset by conducting high-level summary statistics (number and type of variables, number of observations, etc.). This also involved exchange with the respective data owners in order to obtain a precise understanding of the content of each dataset. Finally, we also assessed the data quality by checking for missing values, duplicate records or possible inconsistencies. The most important results of the data exploration phase are presented in @sec-descriptive-statistics.

### Data preparation {#sec-data-prep}

Based on the findings of the data exploration, the data was then prepared for modelling. In a first step, this consisted in the integration of the different datasets into one dataset that can be used for modelling (see @sec-data-description). In the following, we conducted several data transformation steps that we will illustrate in the following.

**Integration of new variables**

In comparison to the current approach, we integrated the following additional predictor variables based on the sources that are listed in section @sec-data-description:

1.  **Number of inhabitants:** The current approach uses the number of inhabitants at the end of each survey year as a basis. However as stated in @sec-problem-definition, this does not account for changes during the year or vacancies of a building. Thus, we recalculated the variable by using quarterly population data and determining the mean number of inhabitants for the respective year.
2.  **Social indicators:** Based on the STATPOP dataset, we calculated the following indicators:[^03-methodology-5]
    1.  Ratio of foreign population

    2.  Ratio of one person households

    3.  Ratio of elderly population (as defined by @oecd2023)

    4.  Youth ratio (as defined by @oecd2023a)

    5.  Ratio of persons that are residents for less than one year.
3.  **Retrofit:** Based on the retrofit datasets, we integrated a binary variable that contains the information if a building has been retrofitted between 2009 and 2020.
4.  **Elevation:** From the DEM, we added a variable that contains the meters above seavel for each building.
5.  **Building connectivity:** Based on the buiding floor plan, we calculated the distance to the next building for each building and subsequently created a binary variable that indicates whether a building is detached or attached to another building.

[^03-methodology-5]: The list of social indicators should not be considered as exhaustive. The idea here was to examine the potential influence of social factors on modeling energy consumption. Thus, we selected the STATPOP variables that seemed to have the most direct influence on energy consumption based on literature and domain knowledge.

**Cleaning and Imputation**

During data exploration, we found that most variables of the dataset indicate a good quality level and we did not detect high numbers of missing values (see @sec-descriptive-statistics). However, in some specific cases we had to take a decision on how to deal with missing values. This is particular true for the variables of the variables *construction year* and *energy usage* of the heating installation. For the construction year of the heating installation, we decided to do a mean imputation for missing values. In the case of energy usage of the heating installation however, this was not possible as it is a factor variable containing the information if the heating system is used for DHW, space heating (SH) or both. Thus, we here encoded missing values as an explicit factor level (*"missing"*).

It is worth noting that some imputation was already conducted during the energy statistics survey. To calculate the variable *heated area*, mean imputation was used in case of missing values for the number of floors (see @statistischesamtdeskantonsbasel-stadt2017a).

**Filtering**

As a last step of the data preparation, it was necessary to apply several filters to the data set to ensure consistent dataset for modelling. The following filters were applied:

-   Only residential buildings in accordance with our research questions
-   Only buildings with a HEPI between 20 and 300 kWh/m²: This filter was introduced as way of handling outliers for the HEPI. In case of very high or very low values for the HEPI, it is not easy to determine whether the values are correct or the result of a error in the underlying variables[^03-methodology-6].
-   Only buildings where the energy usage of the installation is used for SH exlusively or for DHW and SH together. However as mentioned above, due to the high number of missing values, we also included buildings where this information was absent.

[^03-methodology-6]: For example, it is often the case that a heating installation is providing SH to more than one building. However, this information is not always available and will result in a low HEPI as the heated area is too small. Another known source of error is the number of floors of a building that is used to calculate the heated area.

### Modelling {#sec-modelling}

In this step of the CRISP-DM process, we defined the approaches and workflow for modelling the HEC. As it was not clear from the beginning which approach and algorithm will lead to the best results, our modelling process started with an explorative phase where different approaches and algorithms were tested and compared. Based on this results, we then conducted a second modelling phase that focused on training the algorithms on more homogenous subsets of the data. The last step of the modelling process then was dedicated to the model explainability. In the following @sec-modelling-approaches, we introduce two different approaches that were used during the exploration phase. Section @sec-modelling-workflow presents the modelling workflow in detail.

#### Modelling approaches {#sec-modelling-approaches}

The model exploration was conducted in two different ways: First, a custom approach was used. Here, the algorithms, preprocessing steps and also hyperparameter tuning was manually specified[^03-methodology-7]. This offers a high level of control and flexibility. During the custom approach, we trained the model with the following algorithms: MLR, KNN, linear SVM, radial SVM, polynomial SVM, XGBoost and ANN. For hyperparamter tuning, a regular grid search approach with 5-fold cross-validation was used[^03-methodology-8].

[^03-methodology-7]: The custom approach was implemented with [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/). Tidymodels is a collection of R-packages for modeling and machine learning.

[^03-methodology-8]: See the chapter on [grid search](https://www.tmwr.org/grid-search.html "tidymodels grid search") in @silge2023 for details.

Second, we made use of automated machine learning (AutoML)[^03-methodology-9]. The AutoML approach takes care of data preprocessing, feature engineering and model selection. Thus, this approach requires much less manual work throughout the modelling process. However, there is also less control and transparency troughout the modelling process and more time has to be invested in the subsequent model understanding and explainability.

[^03-methodology-9]: For automated machine learning, the open-source [AutoML library of H20](https://h2o.ai/platform/h2o-automl/) was used.

#### Modelling workflow {#sec-modelling-workflow}

The modelling workflow was guided by the research questions as defined in @sec-research-questions and consisted of three steps: First, all the available buildings after applying the filters defined in @sec-data-prep were used for modelling. Based on this dataset, we trained the models with the custom approach as well as with the AutoML approach and evaluated and compared the results on the train set based on the metrics defined in @sec-evaluation-metrics[^03-methodology-10]. In this step, we also explored different selections of predictor variables in order to evaluate the influence of specific predictors (e.g. retrofit). @fig-workflow-step-1 provides an overview of this first step of the modelling workflow.

[^03-methodology-10]: A ratio of 0.75/0.25 was used for splitting the data into train and test set. This counts for all the subesequent modelling steps as well.

![Model exploration (step 1)](figures/03-workflow-step-1.png){#fig-workflow-step-1 fig-align="center" width="70%"}

{{< pagebreak >}}

The second step of the modelling workflow then focused on the subquestions RQ1.1 and RQ1.2 @sec-research-questions: Can we achieve a higher accuracy than the current approach and does the models perform better if we train on more homogeneous subsets of data? We here used the approach with the best performance in step one and divided the dataset into different subsets: By building class, by municipality, by construction period and by survey year. Again, the models were then evaluated based on the metrics defined in @sec-evaluation-metrics. As we here modeled subsets that have different underlying distributions of the HEC, the relative metrics of MAPE (@eq-mape) and CV (@eq-cv-rmse) were used for comparison. Furthermore, we calculated the aggregated error (@eq-agg-error) on municipality level in order to compare it with the error of the current approach.

![Modelling on subsets (step 2)](figures/03-workflow-step-2.png){#fig-workflow-step-2 fig-align="center" width="70%"}

Finally, the last step of the modelling workflow focused on RQ2.1 and RQ2.1: What influence do the additionally integrated predictor variables have on the model? Thus, this last step focused on model understanding and explainability. To answer these questions, we used the approaches defined in @sec-model-explainability-techniques: A analysis of the variable importance was carried out to evaluate the predictive power of the individual predictor variables. Furthermore, the approach of Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) was used to gain more detailed insights on the level of individual predictions.

![Model understanding (step 3)](figures/03-workflow-step-3.png){#fig-workflow-step-3 fig-align="center" width="70%"}

### Evaluation {#sec-evaluation-metrics}

The evaluation in the first step of the modelling workflow consisted on the comparison of the metrics on the train data between the custom approach and the AutoML approach. Based on this, the evaluation in the further stages of the workflow was carried out by using the metrics defined in @sec-evaluation-metrics on the test set.

### Model deployment

The model deployment is not part of this master thesis. However, discuss the results of the work with the relevant stakeholders in the Cantons of Basel-Landschaft and Basel-Stadt and discuss whether and how the models will be incorporated into the future cantonal energy statistics.

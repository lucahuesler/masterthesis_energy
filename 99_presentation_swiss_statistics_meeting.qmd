## Introduction

Growing concerns about climate change and energy scarcity have amplified the need for reliable energy data.

---

## Historical Context

In the canton of Basel-Landschaft, energy statistics have been published since 1990.

---

## New Methodology (2010)

The cantons of Basel-Landschaft and Basel-Stadt jointly developed a new methodology for energy statistics.

---

## Benefits of New Methodology

- Provides estimates of heating energy consumption at the individual building level.
- Utilizes the register of buildings and dwellings.
- Incorporates measured gas consumption data.

---

## Evolution of Data and ML

Since 2010, new data sources and machine learning approaches have emerged.

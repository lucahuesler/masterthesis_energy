# Methodology {#sec-methodology}

## Data unterstanding and exploration {#sec-data-unterstanding-and-exploration}

## Data preprocessing {#sec-data-preprocessing}

In order to prepare the data for modelling, we apply the following filters:

-   Only residential buildings (`gkat = 1020`)
-   Only buildings with a HEPI \> 20 kWh/m² or HEPI \<300 kWh/m²
-   Only buildings where the gas is used for HEC or for DWH+HEC. As this information is absent for many buildings, we also include `NA` values here.

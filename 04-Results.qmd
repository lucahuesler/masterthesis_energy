# Results {#sec-results}

In this chapter, the results of our analysis will be presented. @sec-descriptive-statistics provides the descriptive statistics and exploratory analysis of the data used for modelling. In @sec-model-results, we will present and compare the results of the different models in the order of the modelling workflow defined in @sec-modelling-workflow. Finally, @sec-results-model-explainability will focus on the results of the model explainability techniques (VIA and SHAP).

## Descriptive statistics {#sec-descriptive-statistics}

To gain a first overview of the data that we use for modelling, we here present the summary statistics and visual exploration of the data. The final dataset for modelling is the result of joining data from different sources that are provided in @sec-data-description. Furthermore, we applied several filters that are outlined in @sec-data-prep. We first present a summary statistics overview of all variables used for modelling, followed by a exploratory analysis. Specifically, we will have a closer look at the characteristics of the 20 municipalities that are represented in the data. Exploring characteristics and potential differences on the municipal level can sustain the modelling process by providing insights into the distribution and variability of energy consumption patterns among different municipalities.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Summary statistics overview**

The final dataset for modelling contains `r nrow(energy_modelling)` observations (gas-heated buildings). As we consider data from the years 2016, 2018 and 2020, one building can be present in the dataset three times at maximum. @tbl-summary-stats-numeric provides the summary statistics for all numeric variables. Only the mean number of residents and the social indicators based on STATPOP do contain missing values (with complete rates between 0.97 and 0.99). The distribution of the heated area shows that the dataset contains very small as well as very large buildings ranging from only 35 m^2^ up to 44502 m^2^ with a median value of 207 m^2^.

@tbl-summary-stats-categorical shows the categorical variables used for modelling. The categorical variables do not contain any missing values. The survey year contains the three levels *2016*, *2020* and *2018*. The variables *Retrofitted* and *Stand Alone* are binary variables containing levels *no* and yes (0 and 1, respectively). In the case of case of the *Municipality Name* and *Construction Period*, the levels are represented by the respective municipality or construction period.

**Explorative analysis**

@tbl-obs-per-year shows the mean of HEPI and the total HEC in GWh per year for the survey years of 2016, 2018 and 2020. We can observe that both the mean HEPI and the total HEC is decreasing from 2016 to 2020.

```{r}

  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE, digits = 1)

```

The buildings are located in 20 different municipalities of the Canton Basel-Landschaft. @fig-buildings-per-municipality shows the number of buildings per municipality. The three municipalities Reinach, Allschwil and Muttenz contain more than 5000 observations each and count together for about one third of the all buildings. On the other hand, we also observe the presence of smaller municipalities like Schönenbuch, Pfeffingen and Augst that only count a few hundert buildings in the dataset.

```{r}
#| label: fig-buildings-per-municipality

energy_modelling %>%
  count(municipality_name, name = "n_obs") %>%
  arrange(n_obs) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = n_obs, y = reorder(municipality_name, n_obs))) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(x = "Number of buildings",
       y = "Municipality") 
```

```{r}

}
#> Creating boxplots for different input variables
boxplot_construction_year <- plot_boxplot(energy_modelling, "construction_year")
boxplot_building_area_m2 <- plot_boxplot(energy_modelling, "building_area_m2")
boxplot_num_residents <- plot_boxplot(energy_modelling, "num_residents_mean")
boxplot_hepi <- plot_boxplot(energy_modelling, "hepi")
boxplot_hec <- plot_boxplot(energy_modelling, "hec")

overview <- energy_modelling |> group_by(municipality_name) |> 
  summarise(mean_hepi = mean(hepi),
             mean_hec = mean(hec),
             median_hepi = median(hepi),
             median_hepi = median(hepi))

```

@fig-municipality-hepi provides a boxplot of the HEPI per municipality. The median values of HEPI range from 77.0 kWh/m^2^\*year (Liestal) up to 94.0 kWh/m^2^\*year (Münchenstein).

```{r}
#| label: fig-municipality-hepi
#| fig-cap: "Boxplot of HEPI per municipality."


boxplot_hepi +
  labs(y = "HEPI")

```

In @tbl-hec-hepi-per-municipality the mean and median values of HEPI and HEC are summarized for each municipality. Again, we observe that there are clear differences in the distributions of HEPI and HEC among the municipalities.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-hec-hepi-per-municipality
#| tbl-cap: "Mean and median values of HEC and HEPI per municipality."
#| tbl-cap-location: bottom
#| warning: false

overview <- energy_modelling |> group_by(municipality_name) |>
  rename(Municipality = municipality_name) |>
  summarise(`Mean HEPI` = mean(hepi),
            `Median HEPI` = median(hepi),
             `Mean HEC` = mean(hec),
             `Median HEC` = median(hec))

overview |>
  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE, digits = 1)
```

@fig-municipality-construction-year shows that there are also considerable differences in the age of the building stock between the municipalities. While in Schönenbuch, 50% of the buildings are built after 1996, the median construction year of Birsfelden is 1926.

```{r}
#| label: fig-municipality-construction-year

**Retrofit information**

```{r}
#| label: indicators-retrofit
#| echo: false

#> Calculations of numbers and indicators for easier use as inline code in text.

n_retrofit <- energy_modelling |> filter(retrofitted == "Yes") |> nrow()

n_retrofit_m01 <- energy_modelling |> 
  filter(retrofitted == TRUE,
         retrofit_investment_costs > 0) |> 
  nrow()

perc_retrofit <- round((n_retrofit / nrow(energy_modelling))*100,digits = 2)
```

With regard to retrofit information, we observe `r n_retrofit` buildings that could be matched with a retrofit measure. This represents `r perc_retrofit` % of all the buildings in the data that we used for modelling.

The retrofit data considers retrofit measures that have been financially supported by the cantonal subsidies program (Baselbieter Energiepaket) since 2009. A first explorative way of analyzing the effect of retrofit measures consists in comparing the mean HEPI of retrofitted building and non-retrofitted buildings. @tbl-retrofit shows the mean HEPI per survey year and building class. For all years and building classes, the mean HEPI of retrofitted buildings is lower. Furthermore, a more important difference in average HEPI between retrofitted and non-retrofitted buildings can be observed for MFH (buildings with two or more apartments) over the course of all three years. This could potentially indicate that retrofit measures are more effective in terms of energy consumption reduction for MFH in comparison to SFH.

### Results of model exploration {#sec-results-of-model-exploration}

According to the modelling workflow defined in @sec-modelling-workflow, the first step of the modelling process focuses on the exploration of different models by using the custom approach and the AutoML approach. We first compare the two approaches based on performance on the train data. @tbl-results-custom-approach shows the metrics of the algorithms used in the custom approach. In the case of the custom approach, *XGBoost* obtains the highest value for R^2^ and at the same time the lowest RMSE value. @tbl-results-test-automl-all-predictors shows the metrics of the models trained with the AutoML approach. Here, the *GBM* model provides the best results. Based on RMSE, we observe that the AutoML approach performs clearly better than the custom approach: For all AutoML models except *GLM*, the RMSE is lower than the RMSE of the custom approach models. Based on this findings during the model exploration, we decided to focus on the AutoML approach exclusively for the subsequent modelling steps.

**Results on test data with all predictors**

@tbl-results-test-automl-all-predictors presents the results after performing the estimations on the test set using all predictors. In general, we observed that the values for RMSE and MAE are comparable to the values on the train data provided in @tbl-results-train-automl-all-predictors and thus did not detect any hint for overfitting on the train data. The *GBM* models showed the best overall performance, having the highest R^2^ value of 0.86 and the lowest RMSE (18796) and CV (0.64). When considering MAE and MAPE however, *DRF* and *Stacked Ensemble* perform slightly better. In this context, it is important to note that RMSE is more sensitive to outliers as it squares the errors before averaging. Thus, while *GBM* might provide better predictions for buildings with a very high HEC, the *Stacked Ensemble* or *DRF* potentially provide better results when the main focus is to minimize the average error.

**Influence of variable selection**

As a last step of the model exploration phase, we tested the performance with different variable selections (see @fig-workflow-step-1). Five different predictor selections were tested in this step:

1.  All predictors as shown in @tbl-summary-stats-numeric and @tbl-summary-stats-categorical
2.  Only a basic selection of predictors (number of residents, heated area, construction year of installation, building class, construction year of building and heating degree days).
3.  All predictors without the retrofit variable
4.  All predictors without the stand alone variable
5.  All predictors without the social indicators (ratio of foreign residents, elderly ratio, youth ratio, ratio of residents less than 1 year)

@tbl-results-test-automl-different-predictors compares the best performing model of each variable selection based on RMSE. For all variable selections, *GBM* showed the best performance in terms of RMSE (see also appendix @sec-appendix-variable-selections). Regarding the variable selections, the model without social indicators did provide the best results for all the metrics. This does not necessarily indicate that socio-economic factors have no influence on energy consumption. More likely, it shows that the spatial resolution of the input data is not precise enough to improve the performance of our model.

Furthermore, we observed that the models without the retrofit variable and without the information if a building is connected to another building have a slightly higher RMSE than the model using all predictors. However, MAE and MAPE of these two selections were on a similar level as the model using all predictors. Although the model with only the basic predictors showed the poorest performance for all metrics, it is notable that only a basic set of six predictors still delivered a good performance. This indicates that these predictors are fundamental for predicting HEC.

### Results on data subsets {#sec-subset-results}

```

This section presents the results of the second step of our modelling workflow, where different subsets of data were used to train the models. As a result of our findings in the previous step, we used the best performing variable selection and therefore excluded the social indicators for modelling on subsets. All the metrics shown in this section are referring to the respective test data. Although all metrics are provided in the following, it is important to note that the different subsets have different distributions of the HEC and absolute metrics cannot be directly compared. We therefore mainly focus on the relative metrics MAPE and CV for evaluation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Building class subsets**

```{r}
#| label: load-data-subsets-building-class
#| include: false


# auto ml subset building class
file_list <- list.files("models/subset_building_class", pattern = "results_*", full.names = TRUE)
models_by_building_class <- lapply(file_list, readRDS)


# Combine metrics of each subset into one data frame
subset_building_class_train_metrics <- map_dfr(models_by_building_class, ~ .x$train_metrics)
subset_building_class_test_metrics <- map_dfr(models_by_building_class, ~ .x$test_metrics)
```

First, we focus on the results obtained by differentiating based on the building class. The initial dataset for modelling was divided into three subclasses: SFH, MFH with two apartments and MFH with three or more apartments. @tbl-results-single-family-houses illustrates the metrics for SFH, @tbl-results-mfh-2-flats for MFH with two apartments and finally @tbl-results-mfh-3-more-falts for MFH with three or more apartments. Although the best performing model differs for each building class, *Stacked Ensembles*, *GBM* and *XGB* showed similar results in all three cases.

In @tbl-results-test-automl-different-predictors, the best model on all data reached a MAPE of 22.62 and a CV of 0.63. By modelling on building class subsets, we obtained a lower MAPE and CV values in all three cases as shown in @fig-mape-building-classes. In the case of SFH and MFH with two flats, the MAPE decreased to 17.65 and 15.62, respectively. For MFH with three or more flats, the best model showed a MAPE of 20.79. Thus, we can conclude that modelling on building class subsets could improve the results.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Municipality subsets**

In the same way as with the building class, we also trained the models for each of the 20 municipalities. @tbl-results-test-municipality provides the results for each municipality. It's important to highlight that some municipalities, such as Augst and Pfeffingen, contain a relatively low number of observations. Typically, a larger number of observations guarantees more stability and reliability of the metrics. Therefore, the results for municipalities with fewer observations should be interpreted cautiously. Nevertheless, for providing a complete picture of the results, we decided to include these results as well. With regard to the algorithms, *GBM* and *XGB* provide the best values for MAPE and and CV for most municipalities.

```{r}
#| label: load-data-subsets-building-municipality
#| include: false


# auto ml subset municipality
file_list <- list.files("models/subset_municipality", pattern = "results_*", full.names = TRUE)
models_by_municipality <- lapply(file_list, readRDS)


# Combine metrics of each subset into one data frame
subset_municipality_train_metrics <- map_dfr(models_by_municipality, ~ .x$train_metrics)
subset_municipality_test_metrics <- map_dfr(models_by_municipality, ~ .x$test_metrics)
```

aml_hec_test_metrics_subset_municipality <- bind_rows(
  lapply(models_by_municipality, function(municipality) {
  test_metrics <- municipality$test_metrics

    mutate(Municipality = municipality_name,
           `ntrain/ntest` = paste0(n_train, "/", n_test))
  
}))

Similar to the results for the building class subsets, we generally observed better results for MAPE and CV compared to the results using all data. @fig-mape-municipalites compares the best model for each municipality with the best MAPE when using all data. As it becomes obvious, only the municipalities of Aesch and Birsfelden showed a higher MAPE than the best model using all data.

**Construction period subsets**

In case of modelling on construction period subsets, the results were more heterogeneous: With regard to the algorithms, *GBM* and *Stacked Ensembles* indicated the best performance for almost all construction periods. Only for buildings that were built between *1946-1960*, *Deep Learning* outerperforms the other algorithms (see @tbl-results-test-construction-period).

```{r}

We do not observe a clear tendency for a better accuracy on either newer or older buildings: The construction periods *2011-2015*, *1981-1985* and *1986-1990* showed best accuracy in terms of MAPE (all around 16-17%). On the other hand, the best models for the periods *1946-1960*, *1996-2000* and *2016-2020* did reach a MAPE of around 30% and also rather high CV values. @fig-mape-construction-period shows that we obtain better MAPE results than the approach with all data for seven construction periods, while six construction periods have a higher MAPE value. Thus, we conclude that splitting the data into subsets by construction period does not necessarily lead to better results. However, we want to point out that the construction periods as defined in the RBD were used here[^04-results-1]. This classification of construction periods does not necessarily provide a adequate division with regard to the energy consumption of buildings and their insulation quality. Thus, another classification of construction periods may provide better results.

[^04-results-1]: See the variable [GBAUP](https://www.housing-stat.ch/de/help/42.html#GBAUP) in the RBD feature catalog for details [@bundesamtfürstatistik2022].

**Survey year subsets**

@tbl-results-single-survey-year lists the results for modelling on survey year subsets. *Deep Learning* is the best performing algorithm for 2016 and 2018, reaching a MAPE of about 30%. For 2020, *GBM* provides the best accuracy with a MAPE of about 34%. These MAPE values are clearly higher than the lowest MAPE obtained without subsetting, as shown in @fig-mape-survey-year. Thus, splitting the data into survey year subsets does not improve the accuracy of our models.

### Comparison with the current approach {#sec-comparison-current-approach}

To allow comparison of the model results with the current approach, we calculated the metrics of the current approach for each of the respective test sets. @fig-comparison-current-approach compares the results of the AutoML approach with the metrics of the current approach on the test set. With exception of *GLM*, all the algorithms of the AutoML approach reached a higher accuracy than the current approach.

In the context of municipal energy planning, it is important to also look at the aggregated error on the level of the municipality (see @eq-agg-error). The following @fig-comparison-aggregated-error-municipality compares the aggregated errors of the current approach and the AutoML approach on municipality level. Again, the best performing model was used for comparison (GBM on all data, without social predictors). A first important observation here is that the aggregated error on the whole test set is very low in both cases: While the current approach overestimates the total HEC by 1.5%, the GBM model underestimates the actual aggregated HEC of the test set by only 0.02%. For 11 out of the 20 municipalities, *GBM* predicts the HEC on municipal level more accurate than the current approach. For Arlesheim and Liestal, *GBM* showed the biggest improvements by lowering the error from over 10% to 0.03% (Arlesheim) and 1.09% (Liestal). For five municipalities, the error is on a comparable level for both approaches: Birsfelden, Binningen, Oberwil, Ettingen and Schönenbuch. Finally for the municipalities of Augst, Aesch, Lausen and Reinach, the current approach provides more accurate estimations of the HEC on municipal level (with an aggregated error more than one percentage point lower than *GBM*).

In conclusion, the AutoML approach demonstrates higher accuracy than the current approach, with the exception of the *GLM* algorithm. The *GBM* model that we used for comparison of the aggregated error on municipal level provides better estimation results for the majority of municipalities. However, there are specific municipalities where the current approach performs better. In these cases, further analysis and adjustments are required to improve the predictions of the AutoML approach.

## Results of model explainability {#sec-results-model-explainability}

According to the last step of the methodology, this section focuses on model explainability by presenting the results of the variable importance and SHAP analysis. For the purpose of model understanding, we used again the best performing model according to the results in @sec-results-of-model-exploration (*GBM* model trained on all data without the social indicators as predictors). Thus, the following analysis is not representative for all the previously presented models. Rather, it should serve as an illustrative example on providing insights for black-box models.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Variable importance**

@fig-varimp-plot illustrates the scaled variable importance of the ten most important predictors of the GBM model.

```

Not surprisingly and in accordance with the observations made by @olu-ajayi2022, the heated area is clearly the most important predictor variable by contributing about 84% to the overall importance. The second important predictor is the municipality, which contributes about 7% to the overall importance. With regard to our research question RQ2.1 and RQ2.2, we can state that the retrofit predictor does not not appear in the ten most important predictors of this model. However, as shown in @tbl-retrofit, retrofitted buildings showed a lower HEPI for all building classes. Thus, the interpretation of this observation is not straight-forward and would need further investigation: While this could lead to the conclusion that retrofitting is not important in relation to the other predictors, it could also point out that different ways of preprocessing the retrofit information is needed (e.g. using the retrofit investment costs instead of a binary variable).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**SHAP analysis**

To gain insights on how a prediction of the model is composed, we used the SHAP values for local explanations. We here present two exemplary cases: First, we focus on a SFH as shown in @tbl-local-explanation-sfh. In that case, the predicted HEC value was about 5% lower than the actual HEC value.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-local-explanation-sfh
#| tbl-cap: "Attributes of SFH in Aesch."
#| tbl-cap-location: bottom

file_list <- list.files("models/all_data/", pattern = "*06-01.rds", full.names = TRUE)
aml_all_without_social <- readRDS(file_list[1])

sfh_example <- aml_all_without_social$test_preds %>%
  filter(egid == 390476) %>%
  select(egid, heated_area_m2, municipality_name, num_residents_mean, survey_year, construction_year, stand_alone, meters_above_sealevel, year_of_installation, efficiency_of_installation, building_class, retrofitted, energy_usage_of_installation, hec, predict) %>%
  rename(hec_actual = hec,
         hec_predicted = predict) |>
  mutate(across(everything(), as.character)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -egid,
               names_to = "Variable",
               values_to = "Value") |>
  select(-egid)

sfh_example <- sfh_example |>
  kable(booktabs = TRUE)

sfh_example

mean_responses <- aml_all_without_social$test_preds %>%
  group_by(heated_area_m2) %>%
  summarise(mean_predicted_value = mean(predict, na.rm = TRUE))



```

@fig-shap-sfh shows the contributions of the most important predictor variables. The mean prediction of HEC in the test data was 29379 kWh/year. From @fig-shap-sfh, we can see that the value of 112 m^2^ for the variable *heated area* contributes about -16150 kWh/year to the prediction. The construction year of the building (1961) increases the prediction by +1460 kWh/year. Furthermore, we observe that information on retrofitting (non-retrofitted building) does only have a marginal effect on the model prediction (+148 kWh/year).

```{r}

{{< pagebreak >}}

In a second example, we investigated the SHAP values of a retrofitted building with a predicted HEC close to the mean prediction of 29379 kWh/year. The corresponding attributes of the building are listed in @tbl-local-explanation-mfh. In this case, the model underestimated the HEC by 8.4%. In @fig-shap-mfh, we observe a different picture of the SHAP values.

![SHAP analysis of MFH with two apartments in Binningen](figures/04-shap-mfh.png){#fig-shap-mfh fig-align="center" width="80%"}

Because the predicted HEC is very close to the mean prediction, the positive and negative contributions almost equalized each other. Again, the heated area contributed the most to the prediction. But interestingly, this negative contribution was almost equalized by the municipality (Binningen). This observation however is in line with the results of @tbl-hec-hepi-per-municipality: Binningen has one of the highest mean values for HEPI. Another important observation was the influence of two variables *stand alone* and *retrofitted*: In this example, the information that the building has been retrofitted clearly reduced the the prediction, while the fact that the building is not connected to another building increased prediction by about 1000 kWh/year.

Based on this observations, we conclude that binary variables *retrofit* and *stand alone* may not have a big impact on the global level of the model predictions as shown with VIA. But on the level of individual buildings, these variables can clearly influence the model's prediction.

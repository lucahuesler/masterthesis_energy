We here used the approach with the best performance in step one and divided the dataset into different subsets: By building class, by municipality, by construction period and by survey year. Again, the models were then evaluated based on the metrics defined in ?@sec-evaluation-metrics. As we here modeled subsets that have different underlying distributions of the HEC, the relative metrics of MAPE (?@eq-mape) and CV (?@eq-cv-rmse) were used for comparison.

## Energy policy in the Canton of Basel-Landschaft {#cantonal-energy-planning}

In 2021, the cantonal government of Basel-Landschaft signed the Climate Charter of the Northwestern Intergovernmental Conference together with the governments of the cantons of Aargau, Basel-Stadt, Jura and Solothurn. In the Charter, the five cantons agree on the net zero target by 2050[^01-introduction-1]. Thus, the energy supply of the participating cantons should be switched to 100% renewable energy sources by no later than 2050 [@nordwestschweizerregierungskonferenz2021].

[^01-introduction-1]: As defined by [@2050ind], the net zero target means that "*from 2050 Switzerland aims to emit no more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than can be captured and stored in natural and technological sinks ('net zero emissions').*"

The current legally valid version of the cantonal energy law defines in [§ 2 (1-4)](https://bl.clex.ch/app/de/texts_of_law/490/art/2) the following goals [@landratdeskantonsbasel-landschaft]:

1.  The end energy consumption (german: Endenergieverbrauch) in the canton, excluding mobility, should be reduced by 40% by 2050 compared to 2000 (6,500 GWh).
2.  The share of renewable energies in total energy consumption (excluding mobility) should be increased to at least 40% by 2030.
3.  In the building sector, the heating demand for **new buildings** should be reduced to an average of 20 kilowatt hours (kWh) per square meter of energy reference area per year by 2030.
4.  In the building sector, the non-renewable heating demand for **existing buildings** should be reduced to an average of 40 kWh per square meter of energy reference area per year by 2050.

In 2022, the cantonal council published a new version of the energy planning report, in which the above targets were reviewed for compatibility with the net zero target. The report states that goal 1 and 3 are not compatible with the net zero target [@regierungsratdeskantonsbasel-landschaft2022]. As a result of this finding, the cantonal government submitted a proposal on behalf of the Landrat in which the two goals are changed as follows [@regierungsratdeskantonsbasel-landschaft]:

1.  The end energy consumption in the canton, excluding mobility, should be reduced by **70%** by 2050 compared to 2000 (6,500 GWh).
2.  In the building sector, the non-renewable heating demand for **existing buildings** should be reduced to an average of 40 kWh per square meter of energy reference area per year by 2050.

### Cantonal energy planning

With the total revision of the cantonal energy law in 2016, the new [§ 3](https://bl.clex.ch/app/de/texts_of_law/490/art/3) on energy planning of the canton was introduced. This § 3 obliges the cantonal government to create an energy plan on the basis of the federal requirements and frameworks and to report the results to the cantonal council. Furthermore, according to [§ 2 (6)](https://bl.clex.ch/app/de/texts_of_law/490/art/2) of the cantonal energy law, the government council must also report periodically on the effectiveness of the (previous) measures.

As integral part of the energy planning, the canton delivers a energy statistics since 1990. Until 2010, the statistics was mainly based on a top-down approach. Since 2010, a bottom-up approach has been introduced.

### Cantonal energy system

In 2020, the gross energy consumption of the canton was about 7600 gigawatt hours, which corresponds to a reduction of 4.4% compared to 2018 [@statistischesamtdeskantonsbasel-landschaft2022]. The following figure \@ref(fig:energieflussdiagramm) provides an overview of the cantonal energy system.

```

## Problem definition {#sec-problem-definition}

As mentioned in @cantonal-energy-planning, the Canton of Basel-Landschaft conducts a cantonal energy statistics already since 1990[^01-introduction-2]. Ever since, the energy consumption had to be estimated at least in parts - namely for energy sources where no measerued data has been available. In particular, this is the case for domestic hot water (DHW) and heat energy consumption (HEC) of residential buildings that are using non-grid connected energy sources such as heating oil, wood-based energy systems or heat pumps. In the latest version of the cantonal energy statistics for the year 2020, about 40% of the total annual energy consumption was based on estimations <!--# to be verified -->.

[^01-introduction-2]: The tables and illustrations of the cantonal energy statistics are available at: https://www.statistik.bl.ch/web_portal/8.

Since 2010, the estimation is based on a new method that has been developed together with the canton of Basel-Stadt @statistischesamtdeskantonsbasel-stadt2022 . The method uses a bottom-up approach and is based on the register of buildings and dwellings (RBD) <!--# Add footnote about difference between federal RBD and cantonal RBD -->. The RBD provides information about every building in the canton, such as the building area, building category or the construction year. The building data from the RBD is then enriched with measured energy consumption data for gas-heated buidlings and further information from other data sources (e.g. the number of inhabitants or characteristics of the installed combustion plant).

The measured gas consumption represents the total annual amount of energy in kWh that the energy provider (Industrielle Werke Basel, IWB) delivers to the building. This englobes DWH as well as HEC and in some cases also energy used for cooking. However, for the estimation of HEC, only the energy consumption that flows into the space heating should be considered. Thus, the gas consumption is adjusted as follows\_

$$HEC = Gas_{Total}*e_{HS} + Solar_{Total} - f_{DHW}*N_{I} \\ 
 where $$ {#eq-hec}

```{=tex}
\begin{flalign}
where
Gas_{Total} = Total \ gas \ consumption \ in \ kWh « as  \ measured  \ by  \ IWB, \\
Solar_{Total} = Estimated \ solar \ production \ in \ kWh \\ 
f_{DHW} = Constant \ estimated \ factor \ of \ DWH \ per \ person \ and \ year \ (850 kWh)\\
N_{I} = Number \ of \ inhabitants\\
\end{flalign}
```
Shortcomings of the current method:

-   Influence of retrofitting is unknown and can not be quantified

-   Socio-economic factors and behaviour of inhabitants is not considered explicitly

-   Randomness of weather is difficult to integrate

## Research questions & goals {#Research-Questions-Goals}

On the basis of the considerations in Chapter [Background](#background) and Chapter , we will here formulate the research questions and also define the goals of the project from a practical perspective.

Main research question:

1.  Can other models deliver predictions of HEC with higher accuracy than the current method?

Sub-questions:

1.  What features in our input data are most important for the prediction of HEC?
2.  Can we achieve a higher accuracy of the prediction if we include retrofit features in the model?
3.  Can we achieve a higher accuracy of the prediction if we include socio-economic features in the model?

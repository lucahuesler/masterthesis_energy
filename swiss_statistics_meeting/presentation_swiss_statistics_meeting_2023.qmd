# Background

::: notes
Hello everybody, i am happy for the opportunity to present you today this project. As you can see in the title already, the project is about estimating the heat energy use of residential buildings.

Before we dive in, a quick note on the background: What i present you today is the product of collaboration between the Canton of Basel-Landschaft - where i work for the Office of Data and Statistics) and the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences (HSLU), where i was studying Data Science. In my master thesis, i decided to

## Why estimating energy consumption?

Canton BL has about 66'000 residential buildings...

</iframe>

::: notes
To give you an idea why an estimation is needed, i would like to show you the following chart: What we see here is the distribution of energy sources of residential buildings in the canton - in total around 65'000 buildings. Ideally, we would have measured data on energy consumption for all of these buildings...
:::

## Why estimating energy consumption?

...but only for about 40% of them, measured data is available.

<iframe src="energy_sources_buildings_bl_measured.html" width="100%" height="700px" frameborder="0">

</iframe>

::: notes
...but in reality, we actually only have measured data for gas and district heating. So for all the grey parts here, we have to rely on an estimation method.
:::

## Current method

Estimation based on measured gas data and register of buildings and dwellings (RBD):

1.  Calculation of heat performance indicators (HEPI) for each building category and construction period (KWh/m²)
2.  Estimation of buildings with unknown consumption (multiplying HEPI with heated area of building)

: Overview of data sources

## Input data

After data cleaning and filtering, the final input dataset for modelling consisted of `r nrow(energy_modelling)` buildings.

```{r}
obs_per_year <- energy_modelling |>
  dplyr::group_by(survey_year) |>
  dplyr::rename("Survey Year" = survey_year) |>
  dplyr::summarise(Count = n(),
                   "Mean HEPI (kWh/m2/year)" = mean(hepi),
                   "Total HEC (GWh/year)" = sum(hec)/1000000) |>
  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE, digits = 1)

```

## Modelling workflow: Step 1

![](figures/worklflow_step_1.png){#fig-workflow-step-1 fig-align="center"}

::: notes
The modelling workflow was guided by the research questions as defined in @sec-research-questions and consisted of three steps: First, all the available buildings after applying the filters defined in @sec-data-prep were used for modelling. Based on this dataset, we trained the models with the custom approach as well as with the AutoML approach and evaluated and compared the results on the train set based on the metrics defined in @sec-evaluation-metrics\[\^03-methodology-10\]. In this step, we also explored different selections of predictor variables in order to evaluate the influence of specific predictors (e.g. retrofit). @fig-workflow-step-1 provides an overview of this first step of the modelling workflow.
:::

## Modelling workflow: Step 2

![](figures/workflow_step_2.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
The second step of the modelling workflow then focused on the sub-questions RQ1.1 and RQ1.2 @sec-research-questions: Can we achieve a higher accuracy than the current approach and does the models perform better if we train on more homogeneous subsets of data? We here used the approach with the best performance in step one and divided the dataset into different subsets: By building class, by municipality, by construction period and by survey year. Again, the models were then evaluated based on the metrics defined in @sec-evaluation-metrics. As we here modeled subsets that have different underlying distributions of the HEC, the relative metrics of MAPE (@eq-mape) and CV (@eq-cv-rmse) were used for comparison. Furthermore, we calculated the aggregated error (@eq-agg-error) on municipality level in order to compare it with the error of the current approach.
:::

## Modelling workflow: Step 3

![](figures/workflow_step_3.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Finally, the last step of the modelling workflow focused on RQ2.1 and RQ2.1: What influence do the additionally integrated predictor variables have on the model? Thus, this last step focused on model understanding and explainability. To answer these questions, we used the approaches defined in @sec-model-explainability-techniques: A analysis of the variable importance was carried out to evaluate the predictive power of the individual predictor variables. Furthermore, the approach of Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) was used to gain more detailed insights on the level of individual predictions.

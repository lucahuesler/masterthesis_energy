## Building energy estimation methods {#energy-estimation-methods}

Building energy estimation or prediction models can be defined as physical or mathematical models that help to determine the energy use of the building sector [@yu2022]. On a global level, the models can be divided into two sub-categories([@deb2021; @bourdeau2019];[@yu2022]):

1.  Top-down approaches
2.  Bottom-up approaches

In the following, the two approaches will be presented. However the emphasis will be on bottom-up approaches, since we consider bottom-up approaches more relevant in the context of this thesis.

### Top-down approaches {#top-down-approaches}

Top-down approaches use aggregated data on regional or national level in order to estimate the energy use of a region or of individual buildings. [@eymann2014] use a top down approach to estimate energy us on cantonal level derived from the national energy statistics of Switzerland.

### Bottom-up approaches {#bottom-up-approaches}

In earlier stages of building energy modelling, the research focused mainly on physics-based or white-box models, where the models tries to simulate the energy use of a building by the use of physical conditions and parameters. As indicate by the name of *white-box models*, these models are usually very good in terms of explainability [@yu2022].

With the increasing availability of more and better data on energy consumption and building characteristics, as well as machine learning algorithms, the so-called *black-box models* became more and more popular.

In the following, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the three model types and provide examples for each of them. Further, we will relate it to our use case as presented in the [problem definition](#problem-definition)

### White-box models {#white-box-models}

Advantages:

-   interpretability

-   high accuracy

-   universality

-   no requirement for historical data

Disadvantages:

-   Need for detailed building information

-   Occupant behaviour is unknown

-   randomness of the weather is difficult integrate

### Black-box models

Typically, there are three groups of independent variables:

1.  Socio-economic parameters (e.g. occupant behaviour)
2.  Weather parameters
3.  Building parameters

Among the most popular black-box models are multiple linear regression (MLR) models, support vector machines (SVM) or artificial neural networks (ANN).

### Grey-box models {#grey-box-models}

## Terminology {#sec-terminology}

Energy always passes through different stages between the first extraction and final consumption (e.g. distrbution, storage). From a high-level perspective, we can differentiate between four stages as illustrated in @fig-energy-stages . Between the different stages, there are always losses through transformation to the next stage.

[![Stages of the energy chain (Source: OurWorldinData.org)](figures/02-energy_terms.png){#fig-energy-stages}](https://ourworldindata.org/energy-definitions)

In the context of this master thesis, we only focus on the last two stages: final energy and useful energy. As defined by the United Nations @departmentofeconomicandsocialaffairsstatisticsdivision2018 [p. 55] , final energy consumption "refers to all fuel and energy delivered to users for both their energy and non-energy uses". While there exist various uses of energy, we exclusively focus on the use of heat generation.

The data used for modelling contains the amount natural gas delivered by the provider to the building and therefore does not take into account potential losses due to the inefficiencies of heating appliances. In the context of @fig-energy-stages, this corresponds to the stage of final energy.

The available data allows to determine the useful energy for heating. Thus, the target variables HEC and HEPI as defined in the @sec-research-questions are referring to the useful energy of a building.
